# Retrospective Facilitator

Guide structured retrospectives to reflect on completed phases, capture learnings, and continuously improve the development process.

## Purpose

This skill facilitates retrospectives using a structured format to analyze what went well, what could improve, and what actions to take. Use this skill after completing each macrocycle phase (Req → Implement → Acceptance → **Retro**).

## When to Use This Skill

Invoke when:

- Completing a development phase
- After major milestone (Phase 1, 2, 3, etc.)
- When significant learning occurred
- After overcoming challenges
- Regularly (every phase completion)

## Retrospective Format

### Standard Template

**Phase Information**:

- Phase name and number
- Estimated vs actual time
- Key features implemented
- Team size (if applicable)

**Five Questions**:

1. What went well? ✅ (Celebrate successes)
2. What could be improved? 🔄 (Identify issues)
3. What did you learn? 📚 (Capture knowledge)
4. Any surprises? 😮 (Challenge assumptions)
5. Metrics review 📊 (Quantitative analysis)

**Analysis**:

- Pattern identification
- Root cause analysis
- Comparison to previous phases

**Action Items**:

- Concrete next steps
- Process improvements
- Technical improvements
- Learning goals

**Assessment**:

- Overall phase rating
- Confidence level for next phase
- Risk identification

## Facilitation Process

### Step 0: Gather Time Tracking Data (REQUIRED)

**BEFORE starting the retrospective**, gather ACTUAL duration for the phase from your time tracking system (e.g., `docs/time-tracking.md`, issue tracker, or time logging tool).

**Extract**:

- Start timestamp
- End timestamp
- Actual duration (in minutes, not hours!)

**CRITICAL**: Use ACTUAL duration from time tracking, NOT estimates. Time tracking provides ground truth.

### Step 1: Context Setting

Establish phase context and refresh memory.

**Questions to Ask**:

- Which phase is being retrospected?
- What were the main goals?
- What was the ACTUAL timeline? (from time tracking)
- What was accomplished?

### Step 2: What Went Well? ✅

Identify and celebrate successes.

**Prompts**:

- What are you proud of?
- What worked smoothly?
- Which practices were effective?
- What made you feel confident?
- Which tools/techniques helped?

**Examples**:

- "TDD approach caught 3 bugs before runtime"
- "BFS algorithm worked correctly on first try"
- "Test coverage exceeded expectations"
- "Performance was better than estimated"
- "Clear requirements prevented rework"

### Step 3: What Could Be Improved? 🔄

Identify challenges and inefficiencies.

**Prompts**:

- What took longer than expected?
- What was frustrating?
- What would you do differently?
- Where did you get stuck?
- What slowed you down?

**Examples**:

- "Integration tests took 2x longer than unit tests"
- "Spent 30 minutes debugging edge case"
- "Test setup was repetitive"
- "Unclear requirement needed clarification"
- "Third-party library documentation was hard to find"

### Step 4: What Did You Learn? 📚

Capture new knowledge and insights.

**Prompts**:

- What new skills did you develop?
- What surprised you about the technology?
- What patterns emerged?
- What would you teach others?
- What do you understand better now?

**Examples**:

- "TypeScript enums prevented bugs"
- "BFS is clearer when broken into small functions"
- "Test helpers significantly speed up test writing"
- "Early returns reduce complexity more than expected"
- "Visual feedback needs immediate response (< 100ms)"

### Step 5: Any Surprises? 😮

Identify unexpected outcomes and assumption challenges.

**Prompts**:

- What was unexpected?
- What assumptions were wrong?
- What worked better/worse than anticipated?
- What didn't match the plan?

**Examples**:

- "Performance was 2x better than target"
- "Color mixing edge cases weren't initially considered"
- "Framework's update cycle doesn't need optimization yet"
- "Tests found bug that manual testing missed"
- "Refactoring took less time than expected"

### Step 6: Metrics Review 📊

Analyze quantitative data.

**CRITICAL**: Use ACTUAL time from your time tracking system, NOT estimates!

**Key Metrics**:

- **Time**: Estimated vs actual (from time tracking!)
- **Test Coverage**: Percentage achieved
- **Bugs**: Found in testing vs manual
- **Performance**: Benchmarks vs targets
- **Code Quality**: Lines of code, complexity
- **Commits**: Number and quality

**Example Analysis**:

```
Estimated: 4-6 hours
Actual: 15 minutes ✅ (from time tracking)
Variance: 16-24x faster than estimate!

Test Coverage: 88% (target: 75%) ✅ Exceeded
Bugs in Testing: 3
Bugs in Manual: 0 ✅ All caught by tests

Performance: 2.3ms (target: <5ms) ✅✅ Exceeded

Commits: 5
Lines of Code: 347
```

**Time Tracking Reminder**:

- Always check your time tracking system FIRST
- Report actual duration in minutes
- Compare actual to initial estimates
- Update future estimates based on actual velocity

### Step 7: Pattern Identification

Identify recurring patterns across phases.

**Look For**:

- Repeated issues
- Consistent strengths
- Trends over time
- Predictable challenges

### Step 8: Action Items 🎯

Define concrete next steps.

**Good Action Items**:

- Specific and actionable
- Assigned responsibility (even if solo)
- Measurable outcome
- Reasonable scope

**Examples**:

- ✅ "Create test helper functions for grid setup"
- ✅ "Add edge case tests earlier in TDD cycle"
- ✅ "Research performance profiling tools for the framework"
- ❌ "Write better code" (too vague)
- ❌ "Be faster" (not actionable)

### Step 9: Overall Assessment

Provide holistic evaluation.

**Rating Scale**: 1-10

- 1-3: Significant issues, major rework needed
- 4-6: Acceptable, notable improvements needed
- 7-8: Good, minor improvements
- 9-10: Excellent, minimal improvements

**Assessment Components**:

- Quality of output
- Adherence to process
- Learning achieved
- Time efficiency
- Team satisfaction (if applicable)

### Continuous Improvement

Track action items across retrospectives:

**Phase 4 Action**: Create test helpers
**Phase 5 Check**: Were test helpers created? Did they help?

**Phase 3 Action**: Add edge case tests earlier
**Phase 4 Check**: Were edge cases tested earlier? Impact?

## Retrospective Anti-Patterns

**Avoid**:

- ❌ Blaming individuals
- ❌ Focusing only on negatives
- ❌ Vague action items
- ❌ Ignoring metrics
- ❌ Not tracking previous actions
- ❌ Skipping retrospectives
- ❌ Making retrospectives too long
- ❌ Not implementing action items

**Do**:

- ✅ Focus on process, not people
- ✅ Celebrate successes
- ✅ Create specific actions
- ✅ Use data to inform decisions
- ✅ Track improvement over time
- ✅ Do retros consistently
- ✅ Keep retros focused (30-45 min)
- ✅ Follow through on actions

## Critical Reminders

- Retrospectives are REQUIRED after each phase
- Be honest about challenges and failures
- Celebrate successes, even small ones
- Create actionable, specific next steps
- Track and review previous action items
- Use metrics to inform decisions
- Focus on continuous improvement
- Document learnings for future reference

Retrospectives are not about assigning blame—they're about learning, improving, and building better software through reflection and adaptation.
